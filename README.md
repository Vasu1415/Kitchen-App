# Basic Project Information 
This is a user-friendly mobile kitchen web app with intuitive design based on Human Computer Interaction principles that allows any user to perform the following tasks
- track shopping items
- manage inventory of items and keep track of resources available
- create user groups with friends to plan meals together
- monitor allergies for a recipe and another user in the same group
# Next Steps
- This project currently doesn't use any formal backend interface for the purpose of storing of information about the different recipe's and user profiles. Thus, addition of this interface would be greatly helpful in improving user experience with the application. 
- Use more recent frameworks for the purpose of improving the functionality and aesthetics associated with the project.
